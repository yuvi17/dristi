		      		Dristi, BIT Mesra Chapter, was founded when Vikas Pandey, a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student of the institute got together with like-minded individuals of his college and decided to do something about the problems plaguing the villages neighbouring the college, namely Panchauli and Masu. From its humble beginnings as ‘The BIT Mesra Boys’ Club’ back in the winters of 2013, Dristi today consists of upwards of 450 members, who are all dedicated to the purpose of betterment of the villagers, and helping them prosper and learn from educated students of the college. Team Dristi’s activities are overlooked by 3 major sub-groups: Diksha, Daamini, Daksha and Disha, which serve the purposes of enlightening the villagers about govt. schemes, encouraging women empowerment in the villages, imparting basic computer skills, and providing career counselling to the villages’ various students respectively. Also, F.C. Dristi and Dristi Tuition Classes help the children of these villages to understand the importance of sports and education in their life, and encourage them to do well in both spheres of their life. Dristi has been fundamental in the overall development of the aforementioned villages that we adopted, and Team Dristi, BIT Mesra will continue its journey, and therefore, the fulfillment of its purposes in the future too.

		      		After two months of inception of DRISTI, students of BIT Deoghar got a chance to be a part of the team. Overwhelmed by such a noble cause, they came up with the plan of opening its chapter in BIT Deoghar. Dristi at BITD focused on the two villages near its campus - Ratanpur and Simeria. The volunteers were able to win trust of the villagers on their maiden visit to the villages for collecting the statistics like condition of education, health, women, and exposure to government policies and career options. Since then they have organised various events in these villages which includes computer classes, career counselling, sessions on women empowerment, various awareness drives on social and health issues and many more. With success of these events the Deoghar chapter aims to expand its horizon.
